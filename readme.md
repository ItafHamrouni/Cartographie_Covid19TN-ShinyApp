
## Motivation
The main idea behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate Corona Virus in Tunisia along with number of cases, recovered, deaths, contaminated area and other informations..

## Data:
Data for the Covid19.TN application is sourced from Ministry of Health Tunisia (http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/fr/). The original data is available as a csv file called "coord_cov". The raw data file, processed data file and my shiny code will be available on my github.

I have tried my best to comment and explain where necessary.


## Help:
In case you observe the data projected on map is incorrect and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated it will be great if you can email me and i will update the same (mail: itafhamrouni@gmail.com).
